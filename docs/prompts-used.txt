# Prompts and Implementation Process

## Initial Prompt
"Build a complete, production-minded E-Commerce web application using the MERN stack..."

## Key Requirements Gathered
1. Full authentication system (register, login, logout)
2. Product browsing with search and filters
3. Shopping cart functionality
4. Guest cart with merge on login
5. Checkout flow (mock payment)
6. Responsive UI design
7. Documentation files
8. Seed script for sample products

## Implementation Decisions

### Stack Adaptation
- **Original Request**: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- **Actual Implementation**: FastAPI (Python) + React + MongoDB
- **Reason**: Platform supports FastAPI backend, not Node.js/Express

### Design Choices
1. **State Management**: Context API + useReducer instead of Redux
   - Lighter weight
   - Sufficient for app complexity
   - Built-in React solution

2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
   - Modern, utility-first approach
   - Pre-built accessible components
   - Highly customizable

3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens
   - Stateless authentication
   - Easy to scale
   - Industry standard

4. **Database Driver**: Motor (async MongoDB driver)
   - Non-blocking operations
   - Better performance
   - Native FastAPI integration

5. **Cart Strategy**: 
   - Guest: localStorage
   - Authenticated: MongoDB
   - Automatic sync on login

6. **Payment**: Mock implementation
   - No real payment gateway
   - UI/UX demonstration only
   - Easy to integrate Stripe later

### Design System
- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body)
- **Color Scheme**: Blue and purple gradients with modern accents
- **Layout**: Clean, spacious, modern e-commerce aesthetic
- **Animations**: Subtle hover effects and transitions

## Innovations Added

1. **Guest Cart Merge Logic**
   - Automatically syncs guest cart with user cart on login
   - Combines quantities if same product exists
   - Seamless user experience

2. **Real-time Cart Count**
   - Badge on navbar shows total items
   - Updates immediately on cart changes
   - Mobile-responsive

3. **Search and Filters**
   - Live product search
   - Category filtering
   - Combines multiple filters

4. **Free Shipping Threshold**
   - Free shipping over $50
   - Visual indicator showing how much more to add
   - Encourages larger purchases

5. **Toast Notifications**
   - User feedback for all actions
   - Success/error states
   - Non-intrusive design

6. **Stock Management**
   - Shows available stock
   - Prevents ordering out-of-stock items
   - Visual indicators (green/orange)

7. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Tablet and desktop optimized
   - Hamburger menu on mobile

8. **Protected Routes**
   - Checkout requires authentication
   - Automatic redirect to login
   - Preserves intended destination

## Testing Approach
- Comprehensive data-testid attributes on all interactive elements
- Ready for automated testing
- Manual testing performed during development
