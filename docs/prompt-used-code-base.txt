Prompt that i gave to fetch the prompt from chatgpt:


You are a senior full-stack engineer.
Build a complete E-Commerce Web Application using FastAPI (Python) for the backend and React for the frontend.
The app should let users:
Browse and search products
View product details
Add and remove products from a cart
Manage quantities and view total cost
Register and log in with JWT authentication
The backend should be FastAPI + MongoDB (Motor driver) with bcrypt for password hashing and Pydantic for schema validation.
The frontend should be built with React 19, React Router DOM v7, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for styling, Axios for API calls, and Context API for state management.
Deliver these artifacts:
Technical architecture documentation (docs/architecture.md)
Functional codebase (frontend + backend)
Prompts used for generation (docs/prompts-used.txt)
Include:
Clear folder structure
All required code files
.env.example file
README with setup and run instructions
Keep the design modern, responsive, and production-ready.
End with an architecture explanation and run commands.

Prompt that i gave it to the AI to build :


Role: You are a senior full-stack engineer and software architect.
Goal: Create a complete, modular, production-ready E-Commerce Web Application with the following tech stack:
Backend (Python):
FastAPI (v0.110+)
MongoDB Atlas using Motor (async driver)
JWT authentication with bcrypt
Pydantic models for validation
Frontend (React):
React 19
React Router DOM v7
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for modern responsive UI
Context API for cart and user state management
Axios for REST API calls
Sonner for toast notifications
Functional Requirements
Users can:
Browse and filter products
View detailed product pages
Add or remove items from the cart
Adjust quantities dynamically
See subtotal and total
Register and log in securely (JWT)
Backend APIs:
POST /auth/register – create user
POST /auth/login – authenticate user
GET /products – get product list
GET /products/{id} – get product details
GET /cart – get user cart
POST /cart – add/update item
DELETE /cart/{id} – remove item
Database Models (MongoDB via Motor)
User: { name, email, password_hash }
Product: { name, price, category, description, imageUrl, stock }
Cart: { user_id, product_id, quantity }

Documentation to Generate
docs/architecture.md – System diagram + data flow (Frontend ↔ FastAPI ↔ MongoDB).
docs/api-endpoints.md – All endpoints, request/response examples.
docs/prompts-used.txt – Include this master prompt and sub-prompts.
README.md – Setup instructions, environment variables, and run commands.
Environment Variables (.env.example)
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=8000
Frontend Features
Navbar with cart badge and auth links
Product list and product detail pages
Cart page (quantity management, total display)
Login/Register forms
Global state with Context API
Toast notifications using Sonner
Final Output Must Include
Complete backend + frontend code (file-by-file)
.env.example and requirements.txt
Readable folder structure
Setup commands and run instructions
Short summary explaining architecture and data flow
Final Instruction:
Generate the full runnable codebase (React + FastAPI + MongoDB) with clean architecture, comments, and documentation.
Ensure it can run locally with npm run dev and uvicorn server:app --reload.
End with a short Architecture Summary.
