Prompt to Generate Technical Architecture Documentation


You are a senior full-stack architect.
Create a detailed Technical Architecture Documentation (docs/architecture.md) for a full-stack E-Commerce Web Application built using the following stack:
Frontend:
React 19
React Router DOM v7
Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for responsive UI
Context API for global state management
Axios for REST API communication
Sonner for notifications
Backend:
FastAPI (Python)
MongoDB Atlas with Motor (async driver)
JWT authentication with bcrypt
Pydantic for schema validation
🧩 The documentation should include:
System Overview
Explain the architecture layers (Frontend, Backend, Database) and how they interact.
Include a textual diagram (ASCII style) showing data flow between client, API, and database.
Responsibilities
Define the main responsibility of each layer: UI, API, Database.
Mention how state and authentication are handled.
Component & Module Structure
Describe frontend folder hierarchy (components/, pages/, context/, api/).
Describe backend folder hierarchy (routes/, models/, services/, utils/).
Data Models (MongoDB Schema Design)
Include example Pydantic models for User, Product, and Cart.
Explain relationships and indexes.
API Flow & Endpoints Summary
Show how requests move from React → FastAPI → MongoDB.
Include examples like: Login, Product Fetch, Add to Cart.
Authentication Flow (JWT)
Step-by-step explanation of how JWTs are generated, validated, and used.
Show how protected routes are handled in FastAPI and React.
State Management Flow (Context API)
Explain how the cart and user data are managed globally.
Describe how guest carts merge with user carts after login.
Security & Validation
Mention bcrypt password hashing, token expiration, and Pydantic validation.
Performance & Scalability Notes
Discuss async performance, connection pooling, pagination, and horizontal scaling.
Deployment Overview
Describe how frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render/Railway) are deployed.
Mention environment variables (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT).
Run Instructions (for developers)
Include commands for setting up backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React).
Closing Notes
Summarize trade-offs, extension possibilities (like payments, search filters), and testing approach.

🧠 Tone & Format:

Write it in Markdown (#, ##, lists, code blocks).
Use headings, subheadings, and diagrams for clarity.
Keep explanations detailed but easy to follow.
Aim for a document that would impress a technical interviewer or engineering manager.
